# üå± BIOLNG MANDATE PENALTY - IMPACT ANALYSIS

**Date:** October 17, 2025 @ 11:23:20  
**New Regulation:** Singapore 5% BioLNG Mandate  
**Penalty:** 30 SGD per metric tonne on shortfall

---

## üìã REGULATION SUMMARY

### **Singapore BioLNG Mandate (NEW)**

**Requirement:**
- Importers must have **5% BioLNG content** in their LNG imports
- Effective immediately for all Singapore deliveries
- Penalty for non-compliance: **30 SGD per metric tonne** on the shortfall amount

**Our Situation:**
- **Current BioLNG content: 0%** (no biomethane in our cargoes)
- **Shortfall: 5%** (we don't meet the mandate at all)
- **No plan to change cargo composition** (strategic decision)
- **Result:** Pay penalty on 100% of the shortfall (5% of every Singapore delivery)

---

## üí∞ PENALTY CALCULATION

### **Per Cargo Calculation:**

```
Sales Volume: 4,070,000 MMBtu (typical Singapore cargo after boil-off)

Step 1: Calculate Shortfall Volume
- Mandate: 5% BioLNG required
- Our content: 0% BioLNG
- Shortfall: 5% - 0% = 5%
- Shortfall volume: 4,070,000 √ó 0.05 = 203,500 MMBtu

Step 2: Convert to Metric Tonnes
- Conversion factor: 1 MT LNG ‚âà 48 MMBtu
- Shortfall in MT: 203,500 / 48 = 4,240 MT

Step 3: Calculate Penalty in SGD
- Penalty rate: 30 SGD per MT
- Penalty (SGD): 4,240 √ó 30 = 127,200 SGD

Step 4: Convert to USD
- Exchange rate: 1 SGD = 0.74 USD (approximately 1.35 SGD/USD)
- Penalty (USD): 127,200 √ó 0.74 = $94,128

Result: $94,128 USD penalty per Singapore cargo
        = $0.0231/MMBtu additional cost

## üìä IMPACT ON BASE CONTRACT STRATEGY

### **Before vs After BioLNG Penalty:**

| Month | Destination | Previous P&L | With BioLNG Penalty | Penalty | Change |
|-------|------------|--------------|---------------------|---------|--------|
| **Jan 2026** | Singapore | $23.464M | **$23.370M** | -$94k | -0.40% |
| **Feb 2026** | Singapore | $27.534M | **$27.440M** | -$94k | -0.34% |
| **Mar 2026** | Singapore | $30.586M | **$30.492M** | -$94k | -0.31% |
| **Apr 2026** | Japan | $31.073M | **$31.073M** | $0 | 0% ‚úÖ |
| **May 2026** | Singapore | $31.604M | **$31.510M** | -$94k | -0.30% |
| **Jun 2026** | Singapore | $31.604M | **$31.510M** | -$94k | -0.30% |
| **TOTAL** | - | **$175.86M** | **$175.39M** | **-$470k** | **-0.27%** |

### **Key Findings:**

‚úÖ **Minimal Impact on Base Contract:**
- Total reduction: $470k on $175.9M = **0.27% decrease**
- Per Singapore cargo: ~$94k penalty
- Strategy **UNCHANGED** - Still optimal to use Singapore heavily

‚úÖ **Japan Route Unaffected:**
- April to Japan: No penalty (regulation only applies to Singapore)
- Japan remains competitive alternative

---

## üíé IMPACT ON OPTIONAL CARGOES

### **Optional Cargo Strategy (UNCHANGED):**

**Still selecting 5 Japan options:**
- No Singapore options selected (even without penalty)
- Japan's 90% demand probability > Singapore's 70%
- Shorter voyage, lower costs already made Japan superior

| Rank | Month | Destination | Buyer | P&L | BioLNG Penalty |
|------|-------|-------------|-------|-----|----------------|
| 1 | Apr 2026 | Japan | QuickSilver | $32.94M | $0 ‚úÖ |
| 2 | May 2026 | Japan | QuickSilver | $32.94M | $0 ‚úÖ |
| 3 | Jun 2026 | Japan | QuickSilver | $32.94M | $0 ‚úÖ |
| 4 | Apr 2026 | Japan | Hawk_Eye | $27.04M | $0 ‚úÖ |
| 5 | May 2026 | Japan | Hawk_Eye | $27.04M | $0 ‚úÖ |

**Options Total:** $152.93M (unchanged)

---

## üéØ STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS

### **1. Singapore Remains Optimal for Base Contract**

**Despite the penalty:**
- Singapore base cargoes still most profitable (5 of 6)
- Penalty is only $94k vs $23-31M cargo P&L (0.3-0.4%)
- Strong buyer relationships (Iron_Man) and pricing structure offset penalty

**Why not switch all to Japan?**
- Base contract needs diversification
- Iron_Man premium pricing in Singapore >> penalty cost
- Only 1 Japan base cargo needed for balance

### **2. Japan Dominates Optional Cargoes**

**Already preferred (even before penalty):**
- 90% demand probability (vs 70% Singapore)
- Shorter voyage: 41 days (vs 48 to Singapore)
- Lower freight and boil-off costs
- **Zero BioLNG penalty** (bonus benefit)

**Penalty reinforces Japan preference:**
- Makes Singapore options even less attractive
- Widens the gap between Japan and Singapore option values

### **3. Cost vs Benefit Analysis**

**If we changed to 100% Japan:**
```
Benefit: Save $470k in BioLNG penalties
Cost: Lose Singapore buyer premiums + relationships
      Estimated ~$2-3M in lost margin opportunities

Conclusion: NOT worth switching
            Singapore penalties are manageable
```

## üìà UPDATED TOTAL P&L SUMMARY

### **Grand Total (With BioLNG Penalty):**

| Component | Amount | Change vs Previous |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Base Contract (6 cargoes)** | **$175.39M** | -$470k (-0.27%) |
| **Optional Cargoes (5 cargoes)** | **$152.93M** | $0 (unchanged) |
| **GRAND TOTAL (11 cargoes)** | **$328.32M** | **-$470k (-0.14%)** |

### **Singapore-Specific Impact:**

- **Cargoes affected:** 5 of 11 (45%)
- **Total penalties:** $470,458 USD (127,200 SGD √ó 5 √ó 0.74)
- **Average penalty per cargo:** $94,092 USD
- **Penalty per MMBtu:** $0.0231/MMBtu (vs $7-8/MMBtu total margin)
- **Impact on ROI:** Negligible (~0.14% of total P&L)

---

## üåç COMPARISON TO ALTERNATIVES

### **Hypothetical Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Avoid Singapore Entirely**
```
Route all cargoes to Japan/China
- Save: $470k (BioLNG penalties)
- Lose: ~$2-3M (Singapore premium pricing)
- Net Impact: -$1.5M to -$2.5M ‚ùå
- Conclusion: Worse than paying penalty
```

**Scenario B: Buy BioLNG Credits**
```
Purchase 5% BioLNG content from market
- Cost: Unknown (no market data)
- Risk: Supply availability uncertain
- Regulatory: Complexity of blending
- Conclusion: Not evaluated (insufficient data)
```

**Scenario C: Current Strategy (Pay Penalty)**
```
Accept 5% shortfall penalty
- Cost: $470k total
- Benefits: Keep Singapore relationships
- Simplicity: No operational changes
- Conclusion: OPTIMAL ‚úÖ
```

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è REGULATORY COMPLIANCE STRATEGY

### **Recommended Approach:**

**1. Accept & Pay Penalty** ‚úÖ
- Penalty is economically minimal (0.14% of total P&L)
- Preserves operational simplicity
- Maintains buyer relationships
- No supply chain changes needed

**2. Monitor Regulatory Changes**
- Track potential penalty rate increases
- Watch for BioLNG market development
- Evaluate blending options if penalty escalates

**3. Diversification Already in Place**
- 5 Singapore cargoes (exposed to penalty)
- 1 Japan base cargo (no penalty)
- 5 Japan optional cargoes (no penalty)
- Good balance between markets

---

## üìä SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

### **What if Penalty Doubles (60 SGD/MT)?**

```
Current: $94k per cargo √ó 5 = $470k total
Doubled: $188k per cargo √ó 5 = $940k total

Impact: $940k / $328M = 0.29% of total P&L
Conclusion: Still manageable, strategy likely unchanged
```

### **What if Mandate Increases to 10%?**

```
Current (5%): $94k per cargo
At 10%: $188k per cargo (double)
Total: $940k for 5 cargoes

Impact: Same as doubling penalty rate
Conclusion: Still not material enough to change strategy
```

### **Break-Even Analysis:**

**At what penalty would we switch from Singapore?**
```
Singapore premium margin: ~$2-3M advantage vs Japan
Penalty threshold: $400-600k per cargo
= 4-6√ó current penalty rate
= 120-180 SGD per MT (vs current 30 SGD)

Conclusion: Current penalty far from break-even
```

---

## üèÅ CONCLUSION

The Singapore 5% BioLNG mandate penalty has a **minimal impact** on our trading strategy:

- ‚úÖ **Total Impact:** -$470k (-0.14% of total P&L)
- ‚úÖ **Strategy:** Unchanged - Singapore remains optimal for base contract
- ‚úÖ **Optional Cargoes:** Already 100% Japan (no penalty anyway)
- ‚úÖ **Recommendation:** Accept and pay penalty
- ‚úÖ **Break-Even:** Penalty would need to increase 4-6√ó before strategy changes

**The penalty is a cost of doing business in Singapore that is far outweighed by the benefits of the market and buyer relationships.**
