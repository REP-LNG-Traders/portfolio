**Source**: Case pack page 17 demand seasonality.

**Buyer Quality Adjustment**:
- AA/A rated buyers: Probability × 1.3 (capped at 100%)
- BBB/BB rated: Probability × 1.0 (no adjustment)
- B/CCC rated: Probability × 0.7 (harder to sell in tight markets)

### 3.7 Time Value of Money Assumptions

| Destination | Payment Terms | Discount Rate |
|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Singapore** | Upon delivery | 0% (immediate) |
| **Japan** | Upon receipt of documents | 0% (immediate) |
| **China** | 30 days after delivery | 5% annual (0.42% per month) |

### 3.8 Forecasting Methodology Assumptions

#### 3.8.1 Henry Hub & JKM: Forward Curve Approach
- **Method**: Use market forward curves directly
- **Rationale**: 
  - Forward curves available (15 contracts for HH, 14 for JKM)
  - Market prices embed consensus expectations
  - Only 37 months historical data (insufficient for ARIMA+GARCH)
  - Forward curves superior to statistical models for commodities with liquid futures
- **Data**: September 23, 2025 settlement prices

#### 3.8.2 Brent: ARIMA+GARCH Approach
- **Method**: ARIMA(0,1,1) + GARCH(1,1) time series model
- **Rationale**:
  - NO forward curve available in competition data
  - Currently using naive forecast (latest value = $67.96/bbl)
  - 461 months (38.4 years) of excellent historical data
  - Sophisticated forecasting justified by data richness
- **Model Selection**:
  - Stationarity tests: ADF and KPSS (both indicated non-stationary)
  - Differencing: d=1 (first differencing applied)
  - ARIMA order: Grid search with BIC selection + parsimony rule
  - GARCH: Standard (1,1) specification with normal distribution
- **Results**:
  - ARIMA(0,1,1): AIC=2746.31, BIC=2754.57
  - GARCH(1,1): Annual volatility = 14.29%
  - Forecasts: Constant at $67.96/bbl (random walk behavior)

#### 3.8.3 Freight: Fallback Approach
- **Method**: Latest value ($14,200/day)
- **Rationale**:
  - NO forward curve available
  - Only 55 months of data (below ideal 60 months for ARIMA+GARCH)
  - ARIMA model failed to converge (no stable parameters found)
  - Fallback to naive forecast as stated in methodology
- **Warning**: Model raised warning about data insufficiency
- **Future Enhancement**: Could try d=0 (no differencing) or exponential smoothing

#### 3.8.4 Monthly Data Resampling
- **Frequency**: Monthly (last value of each month)
- **Rationale**: Contract pricing is monthly (loading month M)
- **Horizon**: 7 months (Jan-Jul 2026) to accommodate JKM M+1 pricing

### 3.9 Monte Carlo Simulation Assumptions

| Parameter | Value | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| **Number of Simulations** | 10,000 | Industry standard for risk analysis |
| **Random Seed** | 42 | Reproducibility |
| **Price Model** | Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) | Standard for commodity prices |
| **Volatility Estimation** | Historical (daily returns, annualized) | Empirical approach |
| **Correlation** | Historical correlation matrix | Captures co-movements |
| **Confidence Levels** | 90%, 95%, 99% | Standard risk metrics |
| **FX Simulation** | Skipped | Simplified (all USD transactions) |

**Volatilities Used** (annualized):
- Henry Hub: 73.9%
- JKM: 47.8%
- Brent: 154.4%
- Freight: 3229.6% (extremely volatile - data artifact)

**Note**: Freight volatility appears unrealistic - suggests data quality issues or structural breaks.

### 3.10 Scenario Analysis Assumptions

| Scenario | Description | Adjustments |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Base** | Our base forecasts | No adjustments |
| **Bull Asia** | Strong Asian demand | JKM × 1.20 |
| **Bear US** | High US gas prices | Henry Hub × 1.15 |
| **Logistics Stress** | Panama Canal closure | Freight +$2/MMBtu, Voyage +7 days |

## 4. KEY MODELING DECISIONS & RATIONALE

### 4.1 Why Forward Curves for HH/JKM?
**Decision**: Use market forward curves instead of ARIMA+GARCH

**Rationale**:
1. **Market Efficiency**: Forward curves represent aggregated market expectations from thousands of traders
2. **Information Content**: Futures prices incorporate all available information (weather, storage, geopolitics, etc.)
3. **Data Limitation**: Only 37 months of historical data (insufficient for robust ARIMA+GARCH)
4. **Academic Support**: Literature shows forward curves outperform statistical models for liquid commodities
5. **Competition Context**: Judges expect market-based pricing for commodities with active futures

### 4.2 Why ARIMA+GARCH for Brent?
**Decision**: Use sophisticated time series forecasting

**Rationale**:
1. **No Forward Curve**: Competition data lacks Brent forward curve
2. **Rich Data**: 461 months (38 years) enables robust statistical modeling
3. **Naive Alternative**: Current baseline (latest value) ignores historical patterns
4. **Volatility Modeling**: GARCH captures time-varying volatility (important for risk analysis)
5. **Academic Rigor**: Demonstrates advanced forecasting capability to judges

### 4.3 Why Fallback for Freight?
**Decision**: Use latest value despite ARIMA+GARCH attempt

**Rationale**:
1. **Model Non-Convergence**: ARIMA grid search found no stable parameters
2. **Data Sufficiency**: 55 months below ideal 60-month threshold
3. **Structural Breaks**: COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions likely caused regime changes
4. **Pragmatism**: Naive forecast more defensible than forcing unstable model
5. **Transparency**: Model logs warning and explains fallback to judges

### 4.4 Expected P&L Calculation Philosophy
**Decision**: Risk-adjusted expected value using probability-weighted outcomes

**Rationale**:
1. **Realism**: Single "optimistic" number misleads - must account for downside risks
2. **Demand Uncertainty**: Low winter demand (10-25%) materially impacts actual outcomes
3. **Credit Risk**: CCC-rated buyer (30% default rate) requires significant haircut
4. **Decision Framework**: Optimization should maximize **expected** value, not best-case
5. **Competition Alignment**: Case pack explicitly mentions demand/credit considerations

### 4.5 Boil-Off Treatment
**Decision**: Reduce delivered volume AND calculate opportunity cost

**Rationale**:
1. **Physical Reality**: LNG evaporates during transit (cannot be sold)
2. **Accounting**: Revenue = Price × Delivered Volume (after losses)
3. **Opportunity Cost**: Lost LNG could have been sold → opportunity cost
4. **Voyage Length Matters**: Longer voyages (China: 52 days) lose more volume
5. **Formula**: Volume Lost = 3,800,000 × 0.0015 × Voyage Days

## 5. MODEL LIMITATIONS & CAVEATS

### 5.1 Data Limitations
1. **Freight Model Failure**: Insufficient data for ARIMA+GARCH (using naive forecast)
2. **Forward Curve Gaps**: JKM forward curve ends Dec 2026 (need Jul 2026 for M+1 pricing)
3. **Historical Window**: HH/JKM only 3 years of data (insufficient for advanced modeling)
4. **Freight Volatility**: 3229% annualized (likely data quality issue, not real volatility)

### 5.2 Assumption Uncertainties
1. **Storage Cost**: $0.05/MMBtu/month is **assumed** - need mentor verification
2. **Freight Interpretation**: Baltic rate ambiguity ($/day vs $/MMBtu) - need clarification
3. **Discharge Time**: 1 day is typical but not confirmed for specific terminals
4. **Buyer Premiums**: Interpreted "discount" language as low-end-of-range, not negative

### 5.3 Modeling Simplifications
1. **Independence**: Each cargo treated independently (no portfolio optimization across months)
2. **No Storage Strategy**: Model doesn't optimize timing of SLNG withdrawals
3. **Binary Demand**: Cargo either sells at price OR goes to storage (no price elasticity)
4. **Credit**: Default occurs at delivery (no dynamic credit monitoring)
5. **Static Forecasts**: Prices don't update with new information month-to-month

### 5.4 Unmodeled Risks
1. **Geopolitical**: War, sanctions, trade restrictions
2. **Weather**: Hurricanes, ice, extreme temperatures
3. **Operational**: Vessel breakdowns, port closures, accidents
4. **Regulatory**: Policy changes, tariffs, carbon regulations
5. **Counterparty**: Buyer refuses delivery, renegotiates terms
