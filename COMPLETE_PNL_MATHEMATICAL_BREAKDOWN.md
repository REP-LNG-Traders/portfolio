# 📊 COMPLETE P&L MATHEMATICAL BREAKDOWN
## Month-by-Month Calculation - Every Component Explained

**Run Date:** October 17, 2025 @ 11:27:20  
**Contract Period:** January - June 2026

---

## 🎯 MASTER P&L EQUATION

```
EXPECTED P&L = REVENUES - COSTS - PENALTIES - ADJUSTMENTS

Where:
  REVENUES = Gross Sale Revenue (before adjustments)
  
  COSTS = Purchase Cost + Freight & Shipping + Stranded Volume Cost
  
  PENALTIES = BioLNG Penalty (Singapore only)
  
  ADJUSTMENTS = Credit Risk Cost + Demand Risk Cost
```

---

## 📅 JANUARY 2026 - COMPLETE BREAKDOWN

**Decision:** Singapore → Iron_Man → 4.17M MMBtu (110%)

### **INPUT PARAMETERS:**

```
Market Prices (Forward Curves):
  Henry Hub (HH):     $2.798/MMBtu    (NYMEX forward for Jan 2026)
  JKM (spot):         $11.27/MMBtu    (Forward for Jan 2026)  
  JKM (M+1):          $11.27/MMBtu    (Forward for Feb 2026, used in pricing)
  Brent:              $67.96/bbl      (ARIMA-GARCH forecast)
  Freight:            $10,000/day     (Baltic LNG index, monthly average)

Route Parameters:
  Voyage Days:        48 days         (USGC to Singapore)
  Boil-off Rate:      0.05% per day   (0.0005/day)
  
Volume (Optimized):
  Purchase:           4,170,082 MMBtu (110% of base 3.8M)
  Arrival (after boil-off): 4,070,000 MMBtu
  Sales:              4,070,000 MMBtu (contract maximum)
  Stranded:           0 MMBtu         (optimized to avoid)
```

---

## 💰 STEP 1: PURCHASE COST

### **Formula:**
```
Purchase Cost = Purchase Volume × Henry Hub Price

Where:
  Purchase Volume = 4,170,082 MMBtu
  Henry Hub Price = $2.798/MMBtu
```

### **Calculation:**
```
Purchase Cost = 4,170,082 MMBtu × $2.798/MMBtu
              = $11,667,689
              ≈ $11.67M
```

### **What This Means:**
- We buy LNG at US Gulf Coast at Henry Hub spot price
- Contract allows ±10% flexibility (we choose 110% to maximize profit)
- Paid upfront at loading terminal

---

## 📦 STEP 2: SALE REVENUE (SINGAPORE FORMULA)

### **Formula (Singapore DES Pricing):**
```
Sale Price per MMBtu = (Brent × 0.13) + Buyer Premium + Terminal Tariff

Where:
  Brent × 0.13        = Oil-linked base price
  Buyer Premium       = Negotiated premium for Iron_Man
  Terminal Tariff     = SLNG terminal fees
```

### **Calculation:**
```
Base Price (Brent-linked):
  = $67.96/bbl × 0.13
  = $8.8348/MMBtu

Buyer Premium (Iron_Man):
  = $1.50/MMBtu        (Investment Grade buyer gets best terms)

Terminal Tariff:
  = $0.75/MMBtu        (Singapore LNG terminal berthing & regasification)

Total Sale Price:
  = $8.8348 + $1.50 + $0.75
  = $11.0848/MMBtu
```

### **Gross Revenue:**
```
Delivered Volume (after boil-off):
  Purchase Volume: 4,170,082 MMBtu
  Boil-off (48 days × 0.05%/day): 2.4%
  Arrival Volume: 4,170,082 × (1 - 0.024) = 4,070,000 MMBtu

Sales Volume (capped at contract max):
  = min(4,070,000, 4,070,000)
  = 4,070,000 MMBtu        (exactly at contract cap!)

Gross Sale Revenue:
  = 4,070,000 MMBtu × $11.0848/MMBtu
  = $45,115,136
  ≈ $45.12M
```

---

## 🚢 STEP 3: FREIGHT & SHIPPING COSTS

Freight cost has **7 components:**

### **3.1 Base Freight Cost**
```
Formula: Baltic Rate × Voyage Days × Route Scaling Factor

Baltic Rate:        $10,000/day     (Market charter rate)
Voyage Days:        48 days         (USGC to Singapore)
Route Scaling:      1.0             (No adjustment for Singapore)

Base Freight = $10,000 × 48 × 1.0
             = $480,000
```

### **3.2 Insurance Cost**
```
Formula: Fixed per-voyage premium

Insurance = $25,000 per voyage
```

### **3.3 Brokerage Cost**
```
Formula: Base Freight × Brokerage Rate

Brokerage Rate:     1.25%           (Ship broker commission)

Brokerage = $480,000 × 0.0125
          = $6,000
```

### **3.4 Working Capital Cost**
```
Formula: Purchase Cost × Annual Rate × (Voyage Days / 365)

Purchase Cost:      $11,667,689
Annual Rate:        5%              (Cost of capital)
Voyage Days:        48 days

Working Capital = $11,667,689 × 0.05 × (48/365)
                = $76,790
```

### **3.5 Carbon Cost**
```
Formula: Carbon Rate × Voyage Days

Singapore Carbon:   $500/day        (Regional carbon regulations)
Voyage Days:        48 days

Carbon Cost = $500 × 48
            = $24,000
```

### **3.6 Demurrage (Expected Value)**
```
Formula: Probability-weighted expected cost

Expected Demurrage = $10,000       (Based on historical data)
```

### **3.7 Letter of Credit (LC) Cost**
```
Formula: max(Sale Value × LC Rate, Minimum Fee)

Sale Value:         $45,115,136
LC Rate:            0.15%           (Bank fee for trade finance)
Minimum:            $25,000

LC Cost = max($45,115,136 × 0.0015, $25,000)
        = max($67,672, $25,000)
        = $67,672
```

### **Total Freight & Shipping:**
```
Total Freight = Base + Insurance + Brokerage + WC + Carbon + Demurrage + LC
              = $480,000 + $25,000 + $6,000 + $76,790 + $24,000 + $10,000 + $67,672
              = $689,462
              ≈ $0.69M
```

---

## 🌱 STEP 4: BIOLNG MANDATE PENALTY (SINGAPORE ONLY)

### **Formula:**
```
Penalty (USD) = Shortfall_MT × Penalty_Rate × Exchange_Rate

Where:
  Shortfall_MT = (Sales_MMBtu × Mandate%) × MMBtu_to_MT
  Mandate% = 5%                (Singapore regulation)
  Our BioLNG = 0%              (We don't have any)
  MMBtu_to_MT = 1/48           (1 metric tonne ≈ 48 MMBtu)
  Penalty_Rate = 30 SGD/MT     (Government-set penalty)
  Exchange_Rate = 0.74 USD/SGD (≈ 1.35 SGD/USD)
```

### **Calculation:**
```
Step 1: Shortfall Volume
  Shortfall_MMBtu = 4,070,000 × (0.05 - 0.00)
                  = 4,070,000 × 0.05
                  = 203,500 MMBtu

Step 2: Convert to Metric Tonnes
  Shortfall_MT = 203,500 / 48
               = 4,239.58 MT

Step 3: Penalty in SGD
  Penalty_SGD = 4,239.58 × 30
              = 127,187 SGD

Step 4: Convert to USD
  Penalty_USD = 127,187 × 0.74
              = $94,118
```

---

## 📊 STEP 5: GROSS P&L (BEFORE ADJUSTMENTS)

```
Gross P&L = Sale Revenue - Purchase Cost - Freight - BioLNG Penalty

          = $45,115,136 - $11,667,689 - $689,462 - $94,118
          
          = $32,663,867
          ≈ $32.66M
```

---

## 🎯 STEP 6: CREDIT RISK ADJUSTMENT

### **Formula:**
```
Credit Risk Cost = Default Probability × (1 - Recovery Rate) × Sale Revenue

Where:
  Buyer: Iron_Man (AA rating)
  Default Probability: 0.03% per year    (Investment Grade)
  Recovery Rate: 40%                      (Industry standard)
  Sale Revenue: $45,115,136
```

### **Calculation:**
```
Credit Risk Cost = 0.0003 × (1 - 0.40) × $45,115,136
                 = 0.0003 × 0.60 × $45,115,136
                 = $8,121

Credit-Adjusted Revenue = $45,115,136 - $8,121
                        = $45,107,015
```

### **Updated P&L After Credit:**
```
P&L = $45,107,015 - $11,667,689 - $689,462 - $94,118
    = $32,655,746
```

---

## 📈 STEP 7: DEMAND ADJUSTMENT (PRICE MODEL)

### **Singapore Demand Profile - January:**
```
Annual Demand Allocation: 10%     (Low month for Singapore)
Demand Season: Winter/Off-peak
```

### **Price Adjustment Formula:**
```
If Demand < 20%:
  Price Discount = -$2.00/MMBtu
  
Adjusted Sale Price = Original Sale Price + Discount
                    = $11.0848 - $2.00
                    = $9.0848/MMBtu

Demand Adjustment Cost = Discount × Sales Volume
                       = -$2.00 × 4,070,000
                       = -$8,140,000
                       = -$8.14M
```

### **Why This Model?**
We interpret "% open demand" as affecting **pricing power**, not **sale probability**.

- Low demand (10%) → Competitive market → Must discount to sell
- Sales are certain (M-1 nomination locks in forward contracts)
- But price must adjust to market conditions

**Alternative interpretation (probability model) would give:**
```
If interpreted as probability:
  Expected Revenue = Gross Revenue × 13% probability
                   = $45.1M × 0.13
                   = $5.9M  ❌

This is irrational - wouldn't lift cargo with 13% sale probability!
Therefore, we use PRICE ADJUSTMENT model.
```

---

## ✅ STEP 8: FINAL EXPECTED P&L (JANUARY 2026)

```
FINAL P&L = Credit-Adjusted Revenue - All Costs - Demand Adjustment

Sale Revenue (gross):              $45,115,136
Less: Credit Risk:                 -$8,121
Less: Demand Discount (10% month): -$8,140,000
Net Revenue:                       = $36,967,015

Less: Purchase Cost:               -$11,667,689
Less: Freight & Shipping:          -$689,462
Less: BioLNG Penalty:              -$94,118
Less: Stranded Volume:             $0

FINAL EXPECTED P&L:                = $23,369,599
                                   ≈ $23.37M
```
