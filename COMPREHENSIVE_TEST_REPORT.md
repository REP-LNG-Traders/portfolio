## 🔍 Critical Validations

### ✅ Cancellation Analysis
```
January 2026 Example:
  Options Evaluated:
  1. Cancel: -$5.70M (tolling fee)
  2. Singapore/Iron_Man: +$3.20M ← SELECTED
  3. Singapore/Thor: ~$2.8M
  ...
  
  Decision: LIFT (spread = $8.90M above cancellation)
```

**All 6 months:** Lifting dominates cancellation by $8.9M to $30.0M

### ✅ Sales Volume Compliance
```
Singapore Purchase Optimization:
  Target: Arrival = 4.07M (sales max)
  Reverse calc: Purchase = 4.07M / 0.976 = 4.170M
  Result: Purchase = 4.170M (109.74%)
  Arrival: 4.170M × 0.976 = 4.070M ✅
  Stranded: 0 MMBtu ✅
```

**All destinations:** Zero stranded volume

### ✅ Demand Constraints
```python
# Singapore Feb 2026: 25% open demand
# Iron_Man (AA rated):
prob_sale = min(0.25 × 1.3, 1.0) = 32.5%
expected_pnl = base_pnl × 0.325 + storage_cost × 0.675
```

**Applied probabilistically** (not hard capacity constraint)

### ✅ Credit Risk Modeling
```python
# Expected loss calculation (risk-adjusted returns):
Iron_Man (AA): 
  Default prob = 0.1%
  Recovery = 40%
  Expected loss = $20M × 60% × 0.1% = $12,000

QuickSilver (BBB):
  Default prob = 2.0%
  Recovery = 30%
  Expected loss = $20M × 70% × 2.0% = $280,000
```

**Iron_Man has $268k better expected value** → Selected 5/6 times
