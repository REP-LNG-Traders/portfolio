## üîß Code Changes

### Files Modified:

#### 1. **`config.py`** (Lines 582-701)
Added comprehensive cost configurations:
```python
INSURANCE_COSTS = {...}
BROKERAGE_COSTS = {...}
WORKING_CAPITAL = {...}
CARBON_COSTS = {...}  # Port-specific
DEMURRAGE_COSTS = {...}
LC_COSTS = {...}
SHIPPING_COST_SUMMARY = {...}
```

#### 2. **`src/cargo_optimization.py`**
- **Updated imports** (Line 22-23): Added new cost components
- **Enhanced `calculate_freight_cost()` method** (Lines 105-215):
  - Now accepts `purchase_cost` and `sale_value` parameters
  - Calculates all 7 cost components
  - Returns detailed breakdown with both total and per-MMBtu costs
  
- **Updated `calculate_cargo_pnl()` method** (Lines 327-333):
  - Now passes purchase cost and sale value to freight calculation
  - Enables proper working capital and LC cost calculation

## üìä Example Output

For USGC to Singapore route:
```
Base Freight:      $777,600   (55.6%)
Working Capital:   $322,520   (23.1%)
LC Cost:           $153,000   (10.9%)
Carbon:            $72,000    (5.1%)
Insurance:         $54,167    (3.9%)
Demurrage:         $9,375     (0.7%)
Brokerage:         $9,720     (0.7%)
------------------------
TOTAL:             $1,398,382
Per MMBtu:         $0.411/MMBtu
```

## üìà Impact on Analysis

### Before:
- Only base freight considered
- Underestimated total shipping costs by ~40-60%

### After:
- Comprehensive cost modeling
- More accurate P&L calculations
- Better route comparison
- Carbon cost differentiation by destination
- Working capital costs properly accounted for

---

## üéØ How to Use

### Automatic Integration:
The existing optimization code automatically uses the enhanced freight calculation:

```python
# In your optimization runs
python main_optimization.py  # Will use comprehensive costs automatically
```

### Manual Access:
```python
from src.cargo_optimization import CargoPnLCalculator

calc = CargoPnLCalculator()

freight = calc.calculate_freight_cost(
    destination='Singapore',
    freight_rate=18000,  # Baltic LNG $/day
    purchase_cost=40_800_000,  # Optional but recommended
    sale_value=51_000_000      # Optional but recommended
)

# Access detailed breakdown
print(f"Total: ${freight['total_freight_cost']:,.0f}")
print(f"Per MMBtu: ${freight['freight_per_mmbtu']:.4f}")
print(f"Base Freight: ${freight['base_freight']:,.0f}")
print(f"Carbon: ${freight['carbon_cost']:,.0f}")
# ... and all other components
```

## üìö Documentation

Detailed documentation available in:
- **`FREIGHT_COST_BREAKDOWN.md`**: Complete breakdown with examples for all routes
- **`config.py`**: In-code documentation with sources for each component
- **`src/cargo_optimization.py`**: Method docstrings explaining calculations

## üîç Key Insights

### Cost Rankings (USGC to destinations):
1. **Japan**: $1,351,877 total ($0.398/MMBtu) - Most efficient
2. **Singapore**: $1,398,382 total ($0.411/MMBtu) - Middle
3. **China**: $1,669,877 total ($0.491/MMBtu) - Most expensive

### Why China is expensive despite expectations:
- Longest voyage days (52 vs 41 for Japan)
- Route scaling premium (1.05√ó)
- Higher working capital costs from longer voyage
- Moderate carbon costs

### Major Cost Drivers:
1. Base Freight: 50-60% of total
2. Working Capital: 20-25% of total
3. LC Costs: 10-12% of total
4. Carbon Costs: 5-7% of total (growing)
5. Other costs: ~5% combined

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Run optimization** with new comprehensive costs:
   ```bash
   python main_optimization.py
   ```

2. **Review outputs** - P&L will now reflect true shipping costs

3. **Compare strategies** - More accurate risk/return profiles

4. **Adjust if needed** - All rates configurable in `config.py`
