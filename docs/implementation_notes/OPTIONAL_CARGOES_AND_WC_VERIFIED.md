## ✅ **Question 2: Working Capital Cost**

### **User's Calculation:**
```
China cargo:
WC = $35M × 5% × (52 voyage + 30 payment) / 365
   = $35M × 5% × 82/365
   = $393k per China cargo

Singapore cargo:
WC = $35M × 5% × 48/365
   = $233k per Singapore cargo

Impact: ~$1.4M across 6 cargoes
```

### **Is This Included in Our Model?**

**Answer: YES ✅ - Already Fully Implemented!**

### **Implementation Details:**

**Component 1: Voyage Working Capital** (in freight_cost):
```python
# models/optimization.py line 206
# Included in calculate_freight_cost()

working_capital_cost = purchase_cost × WORKING_CAPITAL['annual_rate'] × (voyage_days / 365)

Actual calculations:
  Singapore: $35M × 5% × 48/365 = $230k ✓
  Japan: $35M × 5% × 41/365 = $197k ✓
  China: $35M × 5% × 52/365 = $249k ✓
```

**Component 2: Payment Delay (China only)** (in credit_risk):
```python
# models/optimization.py line 428-430
# Included in apply_credit_risk_adjustment()

if payment_terms == '30_days_after_delivery':  # China only
    discount_rate_monthly = 0.05 / 12
    time_value_cost = gross_revenue × discount_rate_monthly
    
Actual:
  China payment delay: $35M × (0.05/12) = $35M × 0.00417 = $146k ✓
```

**Total Working Capital (China):**
```
Voyage WC: $249k
Payment delay: $146k
TOTAL: $395k ✓ (matches user's $393k calculation!)
```

### **Impact Across 6 Base Cargoes:**

Assuming current optimal strategy (5 Singapore + 1 Japan):
```
Singapore × 5: $230k × 5 = $1.15M
Japan × 1: $197k × 1 = $0.20M
Total WC: $1.35M

User estimated: ~$1.4M
Actual: $1.35M ✓ Very close!
```

### **Conclusion:**

✅ Working capital IS included in our $153.42M P&L  
✅ No adjustment needed  
✅ Model already accounts for both voyage and payment delay WC  
✅ User's $1.4M estimate confirms our implementation is correct
