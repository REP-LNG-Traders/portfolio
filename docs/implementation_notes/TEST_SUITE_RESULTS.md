## ✅ Detailed Test Results

### TEST 1: Configuration Import ✅
```
✓ Purchase base: 3.8M MMBtu
✓ Sales base: 3.7M MMBtu
✓ Difference: 100k MMBtu
✓ Tolling fee: $1.50/MMBtu
✓ Cancellation cost: $5.7M
✓ Voyage times: Singapore=48d, Japan=41d, China=52d
```

### TEST 2: Boil-off Verification ✅
```
✓ Singapore: 48 days × 0.05%/day = 0.0240 (2.40%)
✓ Japan:     41 days × 0.05%/day = 0.0205 (2.05%)
✓ China:     52 days × 0.05%/day = 0.0260 (2.60%)
```

### TEST 3: Sales Volume Constraint ✅
```
Sales contract max: 4.07M MMBtu

Singapore:
  Effective max purchase: 4.170M (109.74%)
  If purchase 110% (4.18M): Arrival=4.080M, Excess=9.7k MMBtu
  ⚠️ Would create 9.7k stranded volume
  ✓ Constraint prevents this

Japan:
  Effective max purchase: 4.155M (109.35%)
  If purchase 110% (4.18M): Arrival=4.094M, Excess=24.3k MMBtu
  ⚠️ Would create 24.3k stranded volume
  ✓ Constraint prevents this
```

## 🔬 Validation Details

### Sales Volume Compliance Check

**Singapore Cargoes (5 total):**
```
Purchase: 4,170,082 MMBtu (109.74%)
Boil-off: 100,322 MMBtu (2.40%)
Arrival: 4,069,760 MMBtu
Sales Max: 4,070,000 MMBtu
Excess: 0 MMBtu ✅

Within tolerance: 4,069,760 < 4,070,000 ✅
```

**Japan Cargo (1 total):**
```
Purchase: 4,155,181 MMBtu (109.35%)
Boil-off: 85,181 MMBtu (2.05%)
Arrival: 4,070,000 MMBtu
Sales Max: 4,070,000 MMBtu
Excess: 0 MMBtu ✅

Perfect match: 4,070,000 = 4,070,000 ✅
```

### Cancellation Breakeven Analysis

**Minimum margin required to avoid cancellation:**
```
Breakeven = Cancellation cost = -$5.7M

All months well above breakeven:
- January: $3.20M (spread = $8.9M above cancellation)
- ...lowest month still has $8.9M buffer
```

**Sensitivity:** Prices would need to drop 73% for January to favor cancellation

### Credit Risk Expected Loss

**Example: March 2026 Cargo (Singapore/Iron_Man)**
```
Gross Revenue: ~$50M
Iron_Man (AA):
  - Default probability: 0.1%
  - Recovery rate: 40%
  - Expected loss = $50M × (1 - 0.40) × 0.001 = $30,000
  - Net revenue = $50M - $30k = $49.97M
  - Loss impact: 0.06%

If QuickSilver (BBB) instead:
  - Default probability: 2.0%
  - Recovery rate: 30%
  - Expected loss = $50M × (1 - 0.30) × 0.020 = $700,000
  - Net revenue = $50M - $700k = $49.30M
  - Loss impact: 1.40%

Iron_Man advantage: $670,000 per cargo
```
