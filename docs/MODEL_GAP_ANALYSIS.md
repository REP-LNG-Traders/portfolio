# Model Gap Analysis - What's Missing & What Matters

## Executive Summary

Your model is **very strong** - it covers the core competition requirements. However, there are potential enhancements ranging from **critical fixes** to **nice-to-have sophistication**. This document prioritizes them by impact.

---

## PRIORITY 1: CRITICAL FIXES (Do Before Submission)

### 1.1 Freight Data Quality Issue ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**Current State**: 4,983% volatility (data has negative prices, extreme outliers)

**Impact**: 
- Monte Carlo freight risk is completely unrealistic
- Judges will notice and question this
- Undermines credibility of risk analysis

**Solution Options**:

**Option A - Industry Benchmark** (RECOMMENDED - 15 mins):
```python
# In calculate_volatilities_and_correlations():
# Cap freight volatility at reasonable level
freight_vol_calculated = freight_returns.std() * np.sqrt(12)
freight_vol_capped = min(freight_vol_calculated, 0.60)  # Cap at 60%

volatilities['freight'] = freight_vol_capped

# Add comment:
# "Freight data has quality issues (negative prices, extreme outliers).
#  Calculated volatility: 4,983%. Using industry benchmark: 60% (typical pre-COVID)."
```

**Option B - Data Cleaning** (30 mins):
- Remove March 2022 anomaly period
- Winsorize outliers at 1st/99th percentile
- Recalculate volatility on cleaned data

**Option C - Document and Proceed** (5 mins):
- Add big disclaimer in presentation
- Show judges you're aware of the issue
- Focus on HH/JKM/Brent which are clean

**MY RECOMMENDATION**: Option A - Quick fix, defensible, professional

---

### 1.2 Storage Optimization ⚠️ **MISSING FEATURE**

**Current State**: Not implemented at all

**What's Missing**:
You have 12M MMBtu of SLNG storage (case pack page 22) but model doesn't optimize:
- When to withdraw cargoes from storage
- Whether to hold cargoes for better prices
- Storage vs spot market arbitrage

**Impact**: 
- Potentially leaving money on the table
- Judges may ask "what about storage?"
- Missing a key value driver mentioned in case pack

**Solution** (2-3 hours):

```python
# Add to config.py:
STORAGE_CONFIG = {
    'capacity_mmbtu': 12_000_000,
    'cost_per_mmbtu_per_month': 0.05,  # Your existing assumption
    'initial_inventory': 0,  # Start empty
    'withdrawal_flexibility': True,  # Can withdraw any month
    'injection_flexibility': False  # Cannot inject (buy spot and store)
}

# New optimization:
# For each month, decide:
# 1. Take cargo from contract? OR
# 2. Withdraw from storage? OR
# 3. Cancel cargo and pay tolling fee?

# Adds value when:
# - Early months have low prices (store for later)
# - Later months have high prices (withdraw from storage)
# - Demand is low early, high later (match with inventory)
```

**Complexity**: Medium (requires multi-period optimization, not month-by-month)

**Should You Do It?**: 
- **YES if**: You have 2-3 hours and core model is solid
- **NO if**: Running out of time, focus on perfecting existing model
- **JUDGES**: Will appreciate it but not critical if you explain you treated each month independently

---

### 1.3 Volume Flexibility (±10% Tolerance) 💡 **EASY WIN**

**Current State**: Using fixed 3.8M MMBtu, not optimizing volume

**What's Missing**:
Case pack page 15 says ±10% volume tolerance:
- Minimum: 3.42M MMBtu (90% × 3.8M)
- Maximum: 4.18M MMBtu (110% × 3.8M)

**Impact**: 
- Could optimize volume based on margins
- High margin month → take 110%
- Low margin month → take 90%
- Potential extra profit

**Solution** (30 mins - 1 hour):

```python
# In calculate_cargo_pnl(), add volume optimization:
def optimize_cargo_volume(
    destination: str,
    buyer: str,
    prices: Dict
) -> float:
    """
    Optimize cargo volume within ±10% tolerance.
    
    Logic:
    - If margin > threshold: Take 110% (maximize volume)
    - If margin < threshold: Take 90% (minimize volume)
    - If marginal: Take 100% (base case)
    """
    # Calculate margin per MMBtu
    sale_price = calculate_sale_price(destination, buyer, prices)
    purchase_cost = prices['henry_hub'] + 2.50
    margin = sale_price - purchase_cost - freight_per_mmbtu
    
    # Decision rule
    if margin > 5.0:  # Strong margin
        return 3_800_000 * 1.10  # 4.18M MMBtu
    elif margin < 2.0:  # Weak margin
        return 3_800_000 * 0.90  # 3.42M MMBtu
    else:
        return 3_800_000  # 3.8M MMBtu
```

**Expected Impact**: 
- Extra $1-3M in total P&L (optimize 6 cargoes)
- Shows attention to contract details
- Easy to implement and explain

**Should You Do It?**: **YES** - Quick win, shows sophistication

---

## PRIORITY 2: IMPORTANT ENHANCEMENTS (If Time Permits)

### 2.1 Portfolio Optimization (Multi-Month)  🎯 **HIGH VALUE**

**Current State**: Each month optimized independently

**What's Missing**:
- Cross-month dependencies (storage, demand patterns, buyer relationships)
- Portfolio diversification (don't put all eggs in one basket)
- Sequential decision-making (Month 2 decision depends on Month 1 outcome)

**Example Issue**:
```
Current: All 6 months go to Singapore (Iron_Man)
Better: Diversify across destinations to reduce concentration risk
```

**Solution** (3-4 hours):

```python
# Multi-period stochastic optimization
# Objective: Maximize E[Total P&L] - λ × Var[Total P&L]
#            Subject to: Diversity constraints

constraints = {
    'max_same_destination': 4,  # No more than 4/6 to same place
    'max_same_buyer': 3,         # No more than 3/6 to same buyer
    'min_credit_quality': 'BBB'  # No more than 2 to B/CCC buyers
}

# Use dynamic programming or MILP (Mixed Integer Linear Programming)
```

**Should You Do It?**: 
- **YES if**: You want to wow judges, have 3+ hours
- **NO if**: Time-constrained, current model solid enough

### 2.2 Call Option Valuation 📈 **MODERATE VALUE**

**Current State**: Not modeled

**What's in Case Pack**:
You likely have call options on additional cargoes (check case pack for details on options/flexibility)

**What's Missing**:
- Value of flexibility to take extra cargoes
- Real options analysis (when to exercise calls)
- Option premium pricing

**Solution** (2-3 hours):

```python
# Black-Scholes-like valuation for cargo call options
def value_cargo_call_option(
    spot_margin: float,      # Current JKM - HH spread
    strike_margin: float,    # Breakeven margin
    time_to_expiry: float,   # Months until decision
    volatility: float        # Spread volatility
) -> float:
    """Value call option to purchase additional cargo."""
    # Using Black-Scholes for commodity spread options
    ...
```

**Should You Do It?**: **ONLY IF** case pack mentions call options explicitly

### 2.3 Sensitivity Analysis 📊 **MODERATE VALUE**

**Current State**: Scenario analysis (4 scenarios) exists

**What's Missing**:
- Systematic sensitivity to key assumptions:
  - Boil-off rate: What if 0.10% or 0.20% instead of 0.15%?
  - Storage cost: What if $0.10 instead of $0.05?
  - Credit recovery: What if 30% or 50% instead of 40%?
  - Buyer premiums: What if negotiated differently?

**Solution** (1-2 hours):

```python
# Tornado diagram: Impact of each assumption
SENSITIVITY_PARAMETERS = {
    'boil_off_rate': [0.10, 0.15, 0.20],  # %/day
    'storage_cost': [0.03, 0.05, 0.10],   # $/MMBtu/month
    'credit_recovery': [0.30, 0.40, 0.50],
    'buyer_premiums': [0.8, 1.0, 1.2]     # Multiplier
}

# For each parameter:
# - Run optimization with low/base/high value
# - Measure impact on optimal P&L
# - Rank by sensitivity
```

**Output**: Tornado chart showing which assumptions matter most

**Should You Do It?**: **YES** - Judges love sensitivity analysis, shows robustness

---

## PRIORITY 3: NICE-TO-HAVE (Showcase Features)

### 3.1 Learning/Updating Forecasts 🔄 **LOW PRIORITY**

**Current State**: Static forecasts (don't update with new information)

**What's Missing**:
- Update forecasts as cargoes load (incorporate actual prices)
- Bayesian updating of ARIMA/GARCH parameters
- Adaptive strategy (revise decisions based on Month 1, 2, 3 outcomes)

**Impact**: More realistic but complex

**Should You Do It?**: **NO** - Overkill for competition

### 3.2 Transaction Costs 💰 **LOW PRIORITY**

**Current State**: Ignored (as per your design)

**What's Missing**:
- Freight charter costs vs spot
- Hedging commissions ($1/contract = $380/cargo = 0.003%)
- Terminal fees beyond what's stated
- Opportunity cost of working capital

**Impact**: Minimal (<0.1% of P&L)

**Should You Do It?**: **NO** - Not material, mention if asked

### 3.3 Backtesting 📉 **LOW PRIORITY**

**Current State**: Not implemented

**What It Would Do**:
- Test strategy on historical data (2023-2025)
- Validate ARIMA+GARCH out-of-sample
- Show model would have worked in past

**Impact**: Good for academic rigor, not required for competition

**Should You Do It?**: **NO** - Time better spent elsewhere

### 3.4 Visualization Dashboard 📈 **LOW PRIORITY**

**Current State**: Excel outputs only

**What's Missing**:
- Interactive Plotly/Streamlit dashboard
- Geographic routing map
- Animated price paths
- Risk heatmaps

**Impact**: Looks cool but doesn't add analytical value

**Should You Do It?**: **NO** - Focus on analysis, not presentation tech

---

## PRIORITY 4: COMPETITION-SPECIFIC CHECKS

### 4.1 Re-Read Case Pack for Hidden Requirements ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**Action Items**:
1. Check if there are minimum/maximum allocations per destination
2. Check if there are buyer relationship requirements
3. Check if there are regulatory/license limits
4. Check if call options exist on additional cargoes
5. Check if there's a financing/working capital constraint

**Should You Do It?**: **YES** - 30 mins to re-read case pack thoroughly

### 4.2 Verify All Assumptions ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**

**Questions to Ask Mentors** (if possible):
1. Storage cost: Is $0.05/MMBtu/month reasonable?
2. Freight data: Are Baltic rates $/day or $/MMBtu? (data has issues)
3. Buyer premiums: Confirm our interpretation of "discount" language
4. Volume flexibility: Should we optimize within ±10%?
5. Boil-off: Is 0.15%/day standard for modern LNG vessels?

**Should You Do It?**: **YES** - Even if you can't ask, document assumptions clearly

### 4.3 Output Format Check ⚠️ **CRITICAL**

**Verify**:
- What format does competition want? Excel? PowerPoint? PDF report?
- Is there a specific template?
- What metrics must be included?
- Page limits or file size limits?

**Should You Do It?**: **YES** - Check submission requirements ASAP
